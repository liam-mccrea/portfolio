A few examples/pieces of recent projects:
* **analysis_setup.sh**: bash script to streamline the setup of an image analysis run. Creates directores, adds necessary files, and writes custom scripts for future use after each manual step in the process. 
* **Concatenate_motility_results.py**: example python program for data processing that takes individual output files from ImageJ TrackMate cell motility analysis and combines data at the experiment level as well as adds experiment treatment labels to the data.
* **generate_motility_plots_python**: python program to automatically generate plots using the raw output of motility data from ImageJ TrackMate analysis. Helpful for visualizing results before investing more time in the TrackMate analysis.
